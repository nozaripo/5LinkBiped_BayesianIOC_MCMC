# 5LinkBiped_BayesianIOC_MCMC
 This repo contains the code for 5-Link biped model; can be used for both forward and Bayesian inverse optimization of the model.

 Made 3 folders:

 - fiveLinkBiped_Model_Cost_Constraint: The model with the costs and physical constraints and simulator
 
 - DirectCollocation_OC: The codes for implementing forward optimization on the bipedal walking
 
 - MCMC_IOC: All the codes used for implementing MCMC as an inverse optimization for cost inference
